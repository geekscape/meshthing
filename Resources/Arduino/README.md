This is still in progress.

You'll need the Zigduino core folder copied to <arduinoroot>/hardware/arduino/cores. - (ex. ~/arduino-1.0.5/hardware/arduino/cores/zigduino)

pins_arduino.h needs to go in a folder under <arduino root>/hardware/arduino/variants/meshthing - (ex. ~/arduino-1.0.5/hardware/arduino/variants/meshthing/pins_arduino.h)

boards.txt needs to replace the file in <arduino root>/hardware/arduino - (ex. ~/arduino-1.0.5/hardware/arduino/boards.txt)
